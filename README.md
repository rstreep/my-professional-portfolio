# my-professional-portfolio

## Description

My goal with this assignment was to create a coding career portfolio that reflects who I am, why I am interested in coding, a few examples of work I have completed with functional links, and a few methods to contact me. During this assignment I was able to put to practice and implement all of the skills that I have learned thus far including some advanced css skills like flexbox layouts/placement, selectors/variables, and media queries.
